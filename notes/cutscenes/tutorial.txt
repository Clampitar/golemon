[game start]

MC: greetings player! I see you heard my prayer. You must also know my goal,
wih is to prove myself to the wizard council or whatever they're named.
First things first, i'll run you through a tour of how to controll me.
The way I fight is with golems I construct so let's start with their construction
*MC moves to a place with golem making materials)

MC: [asura]ok so first I select the right aterials for the job.
I use hard materials for the hard parts, soft materials for the soft parts, etc.

MC: [naraka]then I arrange th materials into a vaguely human shape. Limbs are essential,
but fingers and fine movement when I can just wack people with a lump of rock

MC: [preta]next I animate the golem. They don't need squishy organs like we humans do,
but they still need a power source connected to its body.

MC: [outer]finally i take controlof the golem. thankfully I don't need a physical connection
for that, so I can stay at a distance.

MC: [animal] I do something that's totally not pokebals so I don't have to lug around a 
golem everywhere I go

[human deliberately missed. deva unsure]
(more golem making tutorial, maybe)

MC: ok! now that you learned how to make golems and remembered how every detail for all eternity,
we're gonna pick a fight with a noob so you can learn how fighting work

noob: hi i'm freinds with the MC or something and i'm willing to have a spar with had to help him with
his training.

*worldbuilding about heaking circles and how they make freindly matches safe*

(the actual fight where MC goes over the mechanics of fighting and how the [human path]
can make people think faster and make better decisions in combat)

*something happens where Player (but not MC) can try the same fight over again)

(note: noob fight has to be hard enough that a large majority of new players will fail and 
then discover save scumming mechanics to succeed.

*MC notices an upgrade in skill and muses about the nature of Player's power
